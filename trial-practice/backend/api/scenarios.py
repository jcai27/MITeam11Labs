"""Scenario catalog and selection helpers tuned for defendant-focused practice.
List available trial exercises, load scenario metadata, and prepare narrative structure (facts, evidence, witnesses, legal issues) for the multi-agent courtroom.
Guidelines:
  - Source scenario definitions from `models.scenarios`, builder scripts, or external fixtures.
  - Offer filtering by courtroom stage, evidence availability, and coach-specified difficulty.
  - Return data shaped for UI rendering, voice narration, and the defense plan console.
