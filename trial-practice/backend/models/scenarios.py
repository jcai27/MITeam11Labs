"""Scenario blueprint definitions for defendant-oriented courtroom rehearsals.
Describe narrative arc, relevant facts, witness list, evidence, legal issues, and learning outcomes tailored to the user playing defense.
Guidelines:
  - Support parameterization (e.g., plaintiff/defendant witness choices, evidence availability, jury temperament) for variety.
  - Provide utilities to serialize for the API and to guide the trial engine's agent choreography.
  - Document how to add or evolve scenario fixtures and variations for new practice paths.
