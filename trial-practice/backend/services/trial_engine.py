"""Core orchestration service driving agent interaction loops with the defendant attorney user.
Coordinate turns among prosecutor, defense companion, judge, witness, and coach while honoring scenario facts, session pacing, and the user's defense goals.
Guidelines:
  - Manage session timing, turn-taking rules, evidence presentation order, coaching cues, and voice playback synchronization.
  - Collect transcripts, evaluations, intervention triggers, and coach annotations for after-action review.
  - Provide controls for pausing/resuming sessions, injecting user prompts, and exporting summaries for transcripts and scoring.
